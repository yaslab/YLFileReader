                   A longer description of YLFileReader in Markdown format.

                   * Think: Why did you write this? What is the focus? What does it do?
                   * CocoaPods will be using this to generate tags, and improve search results.
                   * Try to keep it short, snappy and to the point.
                   * Finally, don't worry about the indent, CocoaPods strips it!
